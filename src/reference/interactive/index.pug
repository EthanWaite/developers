    p.
        Beam Interactive is a new way to let viewers directly control the environment
        around streamers using a visual interface. It works with any game and is built
        into the Beam platform. Interactive games can be played with streamers or fully
        autonomously.
    p.
        Developers can create integrations with as few as 25 lines of code and receive
        input from viewers to influence a live stream directly.
    p.
        Our interactive platform communicates using #[a(href='https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/') Google's Protocol Buffer]
        specification over a standard secure websocket protocol #[code wss] connection. Viewers' inputs from the site are sent to Beam's aggregator
        server, which analyzes them for you, before being sent to clients.
